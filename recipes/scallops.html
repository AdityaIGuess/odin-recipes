        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>As much as I love scallops, I have always been very hesitant to cook with it. After all, at $20 per pound, there is absolutely no room for error when it comes to cooking these. So I just stayed away from scallops and ordered them from fancy restaurants, probably spending 2-3x more.</p>
        <p>Little did I know with a few handy tricks, scallops are actually one of the easiest (and quickest) meals to whip up.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Unsalted Butter</li>
            <li>Scallops</li>
            <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>Unsalted Butter Again</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Lemon Juice</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>Chopped Parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a large skillet over medium high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove the small side muscle from the scallops, rinse with cold water and thoroughly pat dry.</li>
            <li>Season scallops with salt and pepper, to taste. Working in batches, add scallops to the skillet in a single layer and cook, flipping once, until golden brown and translucent in the center, about 1-2 minutes per side. Set aside and keep warm.</li>
            <li>To make the lemon butter sauce, melt 2 tablespoons butter in the skillet. Add garlic and cook, stirring frequently, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in lemon juice; season with salt and pepper, to taste.</li>
            <li>Serve scallops immediately with lemon butter sauce, garnished with parsley, if desired.</li>
        </ol>
